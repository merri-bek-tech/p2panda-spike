# P2Panda Spike for Merri-bek Tech

The goal of this prototype is to determine how the new modular P2Panda 2 could work for us for coordinating sites at [merri-bek.tech](https://merri-bek.tech).

## Usage

Run with `cargo run`. End by pressing CTRL-C. This command line app will announce itself as a site named after your computer's hostname.

If you want to use a different hostname, perhaps so you can run this twice on the same computer as a test, run as `cargo run -- otherhost`
